This is a personal project I built to strengthen my skills in frontend development using React and Firebase. The goal was to replicate the core functionality of Netflix, with dynamic movie and TV show content, user authentication, and a polished interface.

Originally, I planned to use static content, but after discovering the TMDB API, I integrated it to fetch live data such as trending movies, top-rated shows, and more. I also added embedded YouTube trailers to enhance the user experience.
